Revolves around artificial intelligence, namely deep learning. Compares machine learning to deep learning, giving and overall focus on deep learning.
Briefly explain your work on this Project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The Project consisted of neural networks, reinforcement learning, and Q-algorithms. The task for me was to create an intelligent pirate agent to meet the specifications that had been given. The code that needed to be created was the learning algorithm the pirate used to autonomously navigate its environment to solve the map and reach the treasure while avoiding obstacles based on learning habits.

Connect your learning throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
The most important aspect of computer science is problem-solving, an essential skill for life. It's also vital to always remember each requirement while also following the user requirements. On the job, computer scientists use technology to solve problems and prepare for the future. The primary focus, however, is to validate and develop models for interaction between people and computers or software and devices. This is such an essential field because computers and technology have been integrated into virtually every business or operation, Having a significant impact on people's daily lives across the globe.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Solving problems is the core of computer science. Computer scientists must first understand how a human solves a problem, then understand how to translate this algorithm that has been given into something a computer can do, and finally, how to write the specific syntax required by a computer to get the job done. Unfortunately, it is sometimes the case that a machine will solve a problem entirely differently than a human could.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
The ethical responsibilities within an organization should always be the same. Always act with honesty and loyalty on behalf of any business, follow and obey both company policies and maintain respect for the code of ethics.
